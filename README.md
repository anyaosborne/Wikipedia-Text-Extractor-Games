# Wikipedia-Text-Extractor
Provide a list of wikipedia webpage titles and get a directory of text files containing requested page contents


Library Used:
https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/

Requirements: Python3, wikipedia pip3 library

Edit "pageTitleList.txt" and add the requested page titles line by line

Then run in cmd/shell as "python3 getWikiPages.py" 

A new directory will be created by the name "output" and it will have the requested output data

Improvements and corrections are most welcome :)
